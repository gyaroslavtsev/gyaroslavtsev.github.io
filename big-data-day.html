Local computation algorithms for sparse graphs
</a>
<div class="abs">
<p align="left">
Consider a setting in which inputs to and outputs from a computational
problem are so large, that there is not time to read them in their
entirety.   However, if one is only interested in small parts of the
output at any given time, is it really necessary to solve the entire
computational problem? Is it even necessary to view the whole input?
We describe recent work in the model of {\em local computation algorithms} which for a
given input, supports queries by a user to values of specified bits
of a legal output.  The goal is to design local computation algorithms
in such a way that very little of the input needs to be seen in order
to determine the value of any single bit of the output.
In this talk, we describe a number of graph problems for which sublinear time and space local
computation algorithms have been developed.
<p align="left">
This talk will describe joint work with several researchers, including
Noga Alon, Gil Tamir, Shai Vardi, Ning Xie, Reut Levi, Dana Ron,
Andrea Campagna, and Alan Guo.

Approximating matching size from random streams
</a>
<div class="abs">
<p align="left">
We present a streaming algorithm that makes one pass over the edges of an
unweighted graph presented in random order, and produces a polylogarithmic approximation
to the size of the maximum matching in the graph, while using only polylogarithmic space. Prior to this
work the only approximations known were a folklore \(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})\)-approximation with polylogarithmic space in an \(n\)-vertex graph and a constant approximation with \(\Omega(n)\) space. 
Our work thus gives the first algorithm where both the space and approximation
factors are smaller than any polynomial in \(n\).

Turnstile Streaming Algorithms Might as Well Be Linear Sketches
</a>
<div class="abs">
<p align="left">
In the turnstile model of data streams, an underlying vector x in \(\{-m, -m + 1, ..., m - 1, m\}^n\) is presented as a long sequence of arbitrary positive and negative integer updates to its coordinates. A randomized algorithm seeks to approximate a function \(f(x)\) with constant probability while only making a single pass over this sequence of updates and using a small amount of space. All known algorithms in this model are linear sketches: they sample a matrix \(A\) from a distribution on integer matrices in the preprocessing phase, and maintain the linear sketch \(Ax\) while processing the stream. At the end of the stream, they output an arbitrary function of \(Ax\). One cannot help but ask: are linear sketches universal?
</p>
<p align="left">
In this work we answer this question by showing that any 1-pass constant probability streaming algorithm for approximating an arbitrary function \(f\) of \(x\) in the turnstile model can also be implemented by sampling a matrix \(A\) from the uniform distribution on \(O(n log m)\) integer matrices, with entries of magnitude \(poly(n)\), and maintaining the linear sketch \(Ax\). Furthermore, the logarithm of the number of possible states of \(Ax\), as \(x\) ranges over \(\{-m, -m + 1, ...,m\}^n\), plus the amount of randomness needed to store \(A\), is at most a logarithmic factor larger than the space required of the space-optimal algorithm. Our result shows that to prove space lower bounds for 1-pass streaming algorithms, it suffices to prove lower bounds in the simultaneous model of communication complexity, rather than the stronger 1-way model. Moreover, the fact that we can assume we have a linear sketch with polynomially-bounded entries further simplifies existing lower bounds, e.g., for frequency moments we present a simpler proof of the \(\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1-2/k})\) bit complexity lower bound without using communication complexity.

Testing and Reconstruction of Lipschitz Functions
</a>
<div class="abs">
<p align="left">
We will study algorithmic questions about a basic property of functions: the Lipschitz property. The Lipschitz property is defined as follows: a real-valued function \(f\) that takes a vector \(x\) is Lipschitz if for all pairs of inputs \(x\) and \(y\), the value \(|f(x)-f(y)|\) is at most the number of coordinates on which \(x\) and \(y\) differ. We will discuss sublinear-time algorithms for testing whether a function is Lipschitz and for reconstructing Lipschitz functions.
</p>
<p align="left">
We will show applications of these algorithms to differential privacy. The framework of differential privacy allows one to answer global queries about information in a database while protecting privacy specific to individuals whose information it contains. There are many known differentially private algorithms for specific queries and classes of queries. What if database analysts are allowed to write their own programs to access a private database? Can one test if such programs are differentially private? Can one ensure that they are differentially private? We will show that sublinear-algorithms for testing and reconstructing Lipschitz functions can be used to answer these question.

Analyzing Big Graphs via Sketching and Streaming
</a>
<div class="abs">
<p align="left">
Early work on data stream algorithms focused on estimating numerical statistics such as quantiles, frequency moments, and heavy hitters given limited memory and a single pass over the input. However, there's now a growing body of work on analyzing more structured data such as graphs. In this talk, we survey recent research in this area.

Streaming Interactive Proofs or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Trust the Cloud
</a>
<div class="abs">
<p align="left">
We consider the following scenario motivated by the rise of cloud computing.
A client needs to process a massive stream of data, arriving online, but is
unable to store even a small fraction of the data. It outsources the
processing to a commercial cloud computing service, but is unwilling to
blindly trust answers returned by this service. How can we design a suitable
communication protocol between client and server that allows the server to not
just provide the desired answer but prove to the client that the answer is
correct?
</p>
<p align="left">
This general question has been the subject of several recent research works.
In this talk we shall focus on one particular problem of great practical
interest: Nearest Neighbour Search. Our main protocol allows a client to find,
with proof (in the above sense) the nearest neighbour to a query point in a
stream of data points, while storing barely more than a constant number of
points. In fact, the protocol we design is considerably more general, allowing
us to solve many other data streaming problems, and leading to a rich theory
within communication complexity, known as Arthur-Merlin communication. The
talk will outline this theory broadly.
