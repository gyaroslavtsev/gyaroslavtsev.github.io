uld like to state our intent to submit a proposal to the Phase I competition of the TRIPODS program. Our proposal will be titled, “Scalable Algorithms for Detection of Structural Properties of Data.” The PI will be Grigory Yaroslavtsev, Indiana University. The  co-PIs are Sampath Kannan, Robin Pemantle, and Alexander Rakhlin from the University of Pennsylvania, and Eric Price from the University of Texas, Austin. 

Property testing and community detection are both important problems in the context of big data. Property testing and other sublinear algorithms are essential for coping with big data, while community detection becomes an interesting problem only on large graphs. Our work on property testing will seek to relate the difficulty of property testing to the difficulty of learning, and of hypothesis testing in statistics. With better probabilistic analysis, we will design better property testing algorithms whose sample complexity is optimal, even taking into account constant factors. Property testing has a number of applications. We will focus on developing the application of property testing to deep learning.

Community detection has received a lot of attention in recent years. Our goal in this project is to design online community detection algorithms, which seek to classify people as their neighbors and attributes are revealed. This problem has applications to advertising and marketing. We will also consider more general formulations of the community detection problem, beyond the stochastic block model. Specifically, we will consider a class of problems where the nodes come from some metric space, and the probability of an edge between two nodes is a specified function of the distance between these nodes. Our goals are to understand the information-theoretic limits for inference, and to come up with efficient algorithms that do the inference.

At Penn we are launching a Data Science Masters program and a Data Science Minor at the undergraduate level, with the involvement of the CS, Math, and Statistics Departments. At Indiana University a Data Science Masters program has already been very successful and currently attracts more students than Computer Science. Our goal will be to leverage our expertise in Math, Statistics and Computer Science to unify our Data Science curricula and create new courses in this area.
