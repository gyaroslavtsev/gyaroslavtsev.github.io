<h4>Chung-chieh Shan</h4>
<p align="left">
Chung-chieh Shan is an assistant professor at the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University Bloomington.  He studies what things mean that matter.  He works to tap into and enhance the amazing human ability to create concepts, combine concepts, and share concepts, by lining up formal representations and what they represent.  To this end, in the short term, he develops programming languages that divide what to do and how to do it into modules that can be built and reused separately.  In particular, he develops so-called probabilistic programming languages, which divide stochastic models and inference algorithms into modules that can be built and reused separately.  In the long term, he hopes to supplant first-order logic by something that does not presuppose a fact of the matter what things there are, though there may be a fact of the matter what stuff there is.

<h4>Daniel McDonald</h4>
<p align="left">
Daniel McDonald is an Assistant Professor of Statistics and Adjunct Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Indiana University, Bloomington. He was an undergraduate at IU, receiving a B.S.O.F.  in cello performance from the <a href="http://www.music.indiana.edu/">IU Jacobs School of Music</a> and a B.A. in economics and mathematics. After college, he worked at the <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</a> before enrolling at <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a> to pursue a doctorate in statistics. Daniel's main research interests involve the estimation and quantification of prediction risk. He is especially interested in developing methods for evaluating the predictions made using complex dependent data. This includes the application of statistical learning techniques to time-series prediction problems in the context of economic forecasting, as well as investigations of cross-validation and the bootstrap for risk estimation, and examining the trade-offs between prediction risk and computational costs.
