<h3>Chung-chieh Shan</h3>
<p align="left">
<a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/ccshan/">Chung-chieh Shan</a> is an assistant professor at the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University, Bloomington.  He studies what things mean that matter.  He works to tap into and enhance the amazing human ability to create concepts, combine concepts, and share concepts, by lining up formal representations and what they represent.  To this end, in the short term, he develops programming languages that divide what to do and how to do it into modules that can be built and reused separately.  In particular, he develops so-called probabilistic programming languages, which divide stochastic models and inference algorithms into modules that can be built and reused separately.  In the long term, he hopes to supplant first-order logic by something that does not presuppose a fact of the matter what things there are, though there may be a fact of the matter what stuff there is.
