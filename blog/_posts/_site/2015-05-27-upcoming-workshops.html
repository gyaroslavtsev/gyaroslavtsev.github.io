<p>As promised in the New Yearâ€™s post this year there are a lot of activities related to sublinear algorithms and big data.
On behalf of their organizers (<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~andoni/ ">Alex</a>, <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~ashishg/ ">Ashish</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~muthu/ ">Muthu</a>, <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~sergei/ ">Sergei</a> and myself) I would like to invite the readers of this blog to attend them and spread the word.</p>

On June 14, <a href="http://fcrc.acm.org/ ">FCRC 2015</a> will hold a workshop &ldquo;<a href="http://grigory.us/mpc-workshop-fcrc.html">Algorithmic Frontiers of Modern Massively Parallel Computation</a>&rdquo;. 
The program is available <a href="http://grigory.us/mpc-workshop-fcrc.html#schedule">here</a>.
We are very excited to have a great lineup of speakers including:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/">Nina Balcan</a> (CMU)</li> 
<li><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/beame">Paul Beame</a> (University of Washington)</li> <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ravik53/ ">Ravi Kumar</a> (Google Research, CA)</li> <li><a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/mirrokni/Welcome.html ">Vahab Mirrokni</a> (Google Research, NYC)</li> <li><a href="http://research.engineering.wustl.edu/~bmoseley/ ">Ben Moseley</a> (Washington University, St. Louis)</li><li> <a href="http://onak.pl">Krzysztof Onak</a> (IBM Research, NY)</li> 
</ul>
To spice things up, Michael Stonebraker will be giving his Turing Award lecture right after the workshop.

<li> <i class="fa li fa fa-group"></i> On August 27-28 <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/">DIMACS</a> at Rutgers will host a 2-day <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/ParallelAlgorithms/ ">workshop on massively parallel and sublinear algorithms</a>. 
This workshop will feature keynote talks by:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~ashishg/ ">Ashish Goel</a> (Stanford)</li> <li><a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/indyk/">Piotr Indyk</a> (MIT)</li><li><a href="http://hunch.net/~jl/ ">John Langford</a> (Microsoft Research, NYC)</li></ul> 
We will also have tutorials by:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~sergei/">Sergei Vassilvitskii</a> (Google Research, NYC)</li>
<li><a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-dpwoodru">David Woodruff</a> (IBM Research, Almaden)</li>
</ul>
This workshop will be right after RANDOM/APPROX at Princeton to make it convenient to attend both (especially if you are traveling internationally).

</ul>
<p>
I might be forgetting to mention some other events that I haven't been directly involved in, so please comment if there is anything else coming up.

<p>
Also, as a flashback I would like to mention the second &ldquo;<a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com/sublinearday/">Sublinear Algorithms and Big Data Day</a>&rdquo; that took place at MIT on April 10. 
One of the highlights of the event was the poster session which featured a large number of exciting new results in the field. The full list is available <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com/sublinearday/posters.txt ">here</a>. This was probably the most successful poster session I have ever been to and we plan to continue this tradition next year.
Thanks again to <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com/">Gautam</a>, <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/ ">Costis</a> and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/indyk/">Piotr</a> for organization and support!
