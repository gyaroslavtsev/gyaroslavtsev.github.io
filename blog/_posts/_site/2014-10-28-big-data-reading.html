<p>This semester I am running a reading group on <a href="http://grigory.us/big-data-reading.html">algorithms for big data</a> at UPenn.
The goal is to cover some of the most important papers in streaming and massively parallel computation, which came out in the last 5-10 years.
This area is evolving extremely fast, so I will be grateful for any suggestions about the papers missing from <a href="http://grigory.us/big-data-reading.html#topics">our list</a>.
Special thanks to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/silviolattanzi/">Silvio Lattanzi</a> for a few suggestions he gave me while I was visiting Google NYC on Friday!</p>

<p>I also want to give a shout-out for Penn theory graduate students, who made presentations at the group meetings so much more enjoyable than I ever imagined. Thank you, <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~wuzhiwei/ ">Steven Wu</a>, <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~justhsu/ ">Justin Hsu</a>, <a href="http://hans.math.upenn.edu/~ryrogers/ ">Ryan Rogers</a> and <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sassadi/ ">Sepehr Assadi</a>! I guess, some of them are going to hit the internship job market soon. Keep an eye if you are looking to hire in algorithms for big graphs and other data.</p>
