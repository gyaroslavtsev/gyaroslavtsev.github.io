<p>The deadline for submissions to <a href="http://conferences.au.dk/algo16/esa/">ESA’16</a> (24th European Symposium of Algorithms) is in 3 days.
As a PC member I would like to encourage you to submit your work and also plug the event and its location.</p>

<p>This time the conference is a part of a broader symposium <a href="http://conferences.au.dk/algo16/home/">ALGO’16</a> which will take place in Aarhus, Denmark on August 22-26. 
In the spirit of colocation <a href="/stoc-focs-proposal-colocate.html">previously advocated on this blog</a> this symposium brings together several conferences and workshops.
Most relevant to this blog are <a href="">ALGOCLOUD</a> (a new workshop on algorthms for cloud computing) and <a href="http://conferences.au.dk/algo16/massive/">MASSIVE</a> (a workshop on algorithms for massive data). A nice feature of MASSIVE is that it doesn’t have published proceedings. This means that contributions to the workshop can be also published in other conferences.</p>

<p>Aarhus is definitely one of the most vibrant and forward-thinking centers for research in algorithms and theoretical computer science at large in Europe.
I was very lucky to visit the <a href="http://ctic.au.dk/">Center for the Theory of Interactive Computation</a> (CTIC) about 3 years ago.
This Sino-Danish center is a great example of a collaboration between Tsinghua University (the leading computer science institution in China) and its Western partners.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed spending a week at CTIC hosted by <a href="https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~brody/">Joshua</a> and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/matulef/www/">Kevin</a>.
Coincidentally a friendly soccer game between CTIC and MADALGO took place during my visit and I got drafted to play against algorithms folks. 
MADALGO is another joint center (with MIT and MPI) and these guys clearly knew a better algorithm for soccer than we did.</p>
