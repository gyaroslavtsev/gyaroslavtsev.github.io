<p>Two events that might be of interest to the readers of this blog are happening on the East Coast next week.</p>

<p>On Monday–Wednesday (Aug 24–26) a <a href="http://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/big-data/">conference on big data</a> is taking palce at Harvard.
This looks like a very exciting event with broad representation of research from different areas including a lot of theory and algorithms.</p>

<p>On Thursday–Friday (Aug 27–28) DIMACS at Rutgers will host a <a href="http://grigory.us/mpc-workshop-dimacs.html">workshop on sublinear algorithms and big data</a> which will be more focused on the algorithmic questions.
As an organizer, I would like to remind that the early registration and poster submission deadlines for this workshop are <b>tomorrow</b> (Aug 20).
Note, that in many cases for local researchers, students and postdocs affiliated with partners of DIMACS the registration fee can be either significantly reduced or waived.</p>

<p>We are hoping to see some of you at this workshop!</p>
