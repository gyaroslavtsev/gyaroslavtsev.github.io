<b>UPD</b>: Lance created his Theory Jobs spreadsheet, I've moved all the information there and changed the link below to Lance's spreadsheet. 


 <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xBpgBZXcSxjEAbU7SYCeXOJOJtPeXYCOFArqL28Uho8/edit?usp=sharing">Here is a link</a> to a crowdsourced spreadsheet created by Lance Fortnow that collects information about theory jobs this year. <strike>Previously Lance set it up, but this year it is getting late in the year so I decided to go ahead and create one myself. In previous years the jobs post was up a few weeks back so I hope I am not jumping the gun here. Rules about the spreadsheet have been copied from <a href="http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2016/05/theory-jobs-2016.html">Lance's last year post</a> and all edits to the document are anonymized.    
</strike>

 <ul>
 <li>Separate sheets for faculty, industry and postdoc/visitors. </li>
 <li>People should be connected to theoretical computer science, broadly defined.</li>
 <li>Only add jobs that you are absolutely sure have been offered and accepted. This is not the place for speculation and rumors. </li>
 <li>You are welcome to add yourself, or people your department has hired. </li>
 </ul>

This document will continue to grow as more jobs settle.
