The decision to start a blog three months ago proved to be a lot more rewarding and time-consuming than I expected.
Looking at the stats I was thrilled to find out that over its short lifespan this blog has reached 1650 cities in 99 countries. 
This is just a notch over than half of all countries in the world. Among my favorite places reached are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands">Turks and Caicos Islands</a> (overall population ~30 thousand people).

Looking forward into 2015 I am happy to announce that there will be at least two reasons to rejoice for those interested in sublinear algorithms for big data:
<div>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li> <i class="fa li fa fa-group"> </i> The second &ldquo;Sublinear Algorithms and Big Data Day&rdquo; will take place at MIT on April 10. Thanks to <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com/">Gautam "G" Kamath</a> who is in charge of local arrangements and to <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/ ">Costis Daskalakis</a> and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/indyk/">Piotr Indyk</a> for their support!
This event follows <a href="http://grigory.us/big-data-day.html">the first in this series</a>, which I organized at Brown in 2014, and we really hope to keep this tradition for many years to come.
</li>
<li> <i class="fa li fa fa-group"></i> On August 27-28 <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/">DIMACS</a> at Rutgers will host a workshop on massively parallel and sublinear algorithms. 

The organizers, including <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~muthu/ ">Muthu</a>, <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~andoni/ ">Alex Andoni</a> and myself, would like to thank the director of DIMACS <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~rwright1/">Rebecca Wright</a> for helping to make this happen.  Note that this event will be immediately after RANDOM/APPROX 2015 at Princeton (August 24-26).   </li>
</ul>

The details about both events + some more to come will appear on this blog later. Stay tuned and Happy 2015!
