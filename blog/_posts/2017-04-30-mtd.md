<a href="http://caml.indiana.edu/mtd.html">67th Midwest Theory</a> <strike>Day</strike> Weekend took place two weeks ago here at Indiana University, Bloomington organized by <a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/qzhangcs/">Qin Zhang</a>, <a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/yzhoucs/">Yuan Zhou</a> and myself. We were lucky to have a flurry of fantastic speakers from the Midwest and three external headliners: <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~andoni/">Alex Andoni</a>, <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/mirrokni/Welcome.html">Vahab Mirrokni</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/ ">Ryan O'Donnell</a>. Slides are now posted online.

As organizers we've decided to experiment with the format of this MTD making it a 2-day event. Based on feedback we received we believe that this format has worked out perfectly. For a geographically spread out Midwest area travel logistics makes overheads of attending a one-day event often too much for many of those interested to come.
